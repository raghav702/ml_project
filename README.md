# Student Performance Indicator - Machine Learning Project

##  Project Overview

This is an end-to-end machine learning project that analyzes student performance in exams. The project aims to understand how various factors such as gender, ethnicity, parental education level, lunch type, and test preparation course completion affect student test scores.

###  Problem Statement
This project investigates how student performance (test scores) is affected by other variables such as:
- Gender
- Ethnicity  
- Parental level of education
- Lunch type (standard vs free/reduced)
- Test preparation course completion

## 📊 Dataset Information

**Source**: [Kaggle - Students Performance in Exams](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams?datasetId=74977)

**Dataset Details**:
- **Rows**: 1000 students
- **Columns**: 8 features
- **Features**:
  - `gender`: Sex of students (Male/Female)
  - `race/ethnicity`: Ethnicity of students (Group A, B, C, D, E)
  - `parental level of education`: Parents' final education (bachelor's degree, some college, master's degree, associate's degree, high school)
  - `lunch`: Having lunch before test (standard or free/reduced)
  - `test preparation course`: Complete or not complete before test
  - `math score`: Mathematics test score
  - `reading score`: Reading test score
  - `writing score`: Writing test score
